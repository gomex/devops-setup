# Using Homebrew

To install a package (or **Formula** in Homebrew vocabulary) simply type:

    $ brew install <formula>

To update Homebrew's directory of formulae, run:

    $ brew update

**Note**: If that command fails you can manually download the directory of
formulas like this:

    $ cd /usr/local/Homebrew/
    $ git fetch origin
    $ git reset --hard origin/master

To see if any of your formulas need to be updated:

    $ brew outdated

To update a formula:

    $ brew upgrade <formula>

Homebrew keeps older versions of formulas installed on your system, in case you
want to roll back to an older version. That rarely is necessary, so you can do
some cleanup to get rid of those old versions:

    $ brew cleanup

If you want to see what formulas Homebrew would delete _without actually
deleting them_, you can run:

    $ brew cleanup --dry-run

To see what you have installed (with their version numbers):

    $ brew list --versions

To search for formulas you run:

    $ brew search <formula>

To get more information about a formula you run:

    $ brew info <formula>

To uninstall a formula you can run:

    $ brew uninstall <formula>
